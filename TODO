TODO items for gopenvpn
-----------------------

- Support for other desktop environments (Xfce, kde)

- Localization

- Ability to set nameserver automatically

- Ability to add/edit/delete/rename .conf files

- "Reload" command

- Higher quality icons and animation for when connecting

- Compile for archlinux?  There are certainly issues with the use
  of autotools on some (especially older) distros.  We also need it
  to run under Ubuntu Lucid (where it _does_ compile and run but may not
  autoconf properly).
